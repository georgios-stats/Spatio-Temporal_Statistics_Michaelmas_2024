## Description {-}  
The dataset considers trends in the incidence of suicide in London in relation to national trends 
and highlights the distinctive fall in its suicide levels. Within London differentials across boroughs 
and wards are investigated, with particular regard to contextual variability across subpopulations 
in the impact of social deprivation and social fragmentation (anomie). Patterns of causation also differ 
for suicide disaggregated by age group and sex. The relevance of these differentials for explaining the 
distinctive trend in London's overall suicide rate is discussed.
